Currently, the program has one weird bug where you need to use debuger to run it.
Mark some line in the code and press F9. Then press F8 to run the program.
If you don't do this, the program will still work, but it will not let you through the login screen.
First, you need to create a user. Then you can log in with that user.
Remember your password as there is no possibility to change it.
If you forget your password, you need to inform the admin where he will delete the user from the database.
Then you can create a new user with the same username and a new password.
